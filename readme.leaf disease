This project uses image classification to detect leaf diseases from a plant image using a camera, processes the image using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and displays the results along with remedies using a Tkinter GUI. 
It is designed to run on a Raspberry Pi, with GPIO support to potentially trigger actions like alerts or irrigation.

📷 Features :

  - Real-time image capture from a camera
  - Deep learning-based image classification (healthy or diseased)
  - GUI interface for user interaction using Tkinter
  - Provides specific remedies based on the identified disease
  - Compatible with Raspberry Pi GPIO, can trigger relay actions

💡 Diseases Detected :
 
   ✅ Healthy
   🦠 Bacterial Spot
   🟠 Mosaic Virus
   🍂 Spectoria
   🌫 Leaf Mold
   🔁 Curl Virus

🛠 Requirements :

   Hardware:
    - Raspberry Pi (any model with GPIO & camera support)
    - USB/Web camera or Pi camera module
    - Relay Module (optional for GPIO action)
                    
   Software :
    - Python Libraries

 🤖 Install dependencies :

pip install opencv-python numpy tflearn tensorflow pillow matplotlib tqdm
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
Optional for GPIO:

sudo pip install RPi.GPIO
                    
 ⚙️ How It Works

    - GUI opens with "Get Photo" button.
    - Upon clicking:
   - Raspberry Pi camera captures a live image.
   - Image is saved to testpicture/ directory.
   - "Analyse Image" button loads the image into a CNN model trained to classify 6 categories.
   - If a disease is detected:
   - GUI shows disease name.
   - Remedies are shown via a pop-up window.
   - If leaf is Healthy, it displays a success message.

  🧠 Deep Learning Model :

    The CNN model (healthyvsunhealthynew-*.model) is trained using TFLearn on labeled images of diseased vs healthy leaves. Architecture includes:

   - Multiple convolution and pooling layers
   - ReLU activation
   - Softmax output for multi-class prediction
   - You can train your own model using a dataset of labeled leaf images.

  🚀 Getting Started :

   - Clone this repo to your Raspberry Pi.
   - Make sure your camera is connected and accessible.
   - Run the script:
   - python3 leaf_disease_detector.py
   - Follow GUI prompts:
   - Click "Get Photo" to take a live image.
   - Click "Analyse Image" to detect and display disease/remedies.

  💬 Sample Output :

    - Image captured and previewed in GUI.
                    
  🎬 Displays :
                    
    - Disease Name: Spectoria
    - Click below for remedies...
    - [Remedies Button]

  🛡 Troubleshooting :

    - Make sure the camera is enabled via raspi-config.
    - Ensure all Python dependencies are installed.
    - GPIO errors? Run with sudo.

  🔮 Future Improvements :

    - Add voice alert or SMS support.
    - Add database logging of detections.
    - Improve accuracy by retraining the model on a larger dataset.
    - Add web dashboard or mobile interface.
